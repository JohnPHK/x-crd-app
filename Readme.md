# Introduction

This is a Java application that interacts with X REST API to perform create, read and delete (CRD) operations of a tweet.

The application performs each operation by creating an HTTP request and sending it to the X API. Then, it parses and processes the HTTP response received from X API.

`Maven` is used for handling of all dependencies and structuring of the project was accomplished.

For data binding, `jackson` was used for mapping between JSON String and a Java Object.
 
`JUnit` and `Mockito` were utilized for thorough unit and integration testing.

Finally, the project was deployed using Docker.
