# Introduction

This is a Java application that interacts with X REST API to perform create, read and delete (CRD) operations of a tweet.

The application performs each operation by creating an HTTP request and sending it to the X API. Then, it parses and processes the HTTP response received from X API.

The libraries utilized include Jackson and Mockito. Handling of all dependencies and structuring of the project was accomplished through the use of Maven. Finally, the project was deployed using Docker.
