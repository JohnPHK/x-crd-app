# Introduction

This is a Java application that interacts with the RESTful X API to create, read or delete (CRD) a tweet. The application performs each operation by making an HTTP request and sending it to the X API. Then, it parses and processes the HTTP response received from X API.

`Maven` is used to manage all dependencies and build the project's directory structures. `Jackson` was used to map a JSON String to a Java Object. `JUnit` and `Mockito` were utilized for thorough unit and integration testing. Finally, the project was deployed using `Docker`.

The main purpose of this project was to educate me about the Spring Framework. This project taught me the mechanisms behind Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) and how the Spring framework implements IoC/DI to architect application components.
